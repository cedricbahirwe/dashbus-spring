# Bus Ticketing System: (DashBus)
### ID: 23455

A Bus ticket booking application made using Spring Boot (Backend API side) and React JS (Frontend Web Side)


## 1. Project Requirements

### Project Purpose:
The main goal of the Spring Boot backend project is to develop a Bus Ticketing System that enables users to conveniently
book bus tickets online for long-distance trips. The system aims to address the challenges faced by crowded bus parks, providing a digital solution to streamline the ticket booking process. Additionally, the project contributes to the broader objective of digitization in the transportation sector.



### Expected Outcomes:

1. **User-Friendly Booking System**: A user-friendly interface that allows passengers to easily search for buses, and securely book tickets online.

2. **Reduced Crowds at Bus Parks**: Minimize the congestion and waiting times at bus parks by providing a digital platform for ticket booking, reducing the need for on-site ticket purchases.

3. **Digital Payment Integration**: Enable secure online payment options, such as  mobile money, credit/debit cards or digital wallets, to streamline the payment process for users.

4. **Automated Ticketing Process**: Implement an automated ticket generation system that issues digital tickets upon successful booking, reducing manual processes and the likelihood of errors.

5. **Real-time Availability Updates**: Provide real-time updates on bus availability, schedules, ensuring transparency and informed decision-making.

6. **User Accounts and Profiles**: Allow users to create accounts, manage their booking history for a more personalized and efficient experience.


### Functionality:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
    - A secure user authentication system to allow users to create accounts and log in.
    - User roles (e.g., passengers, administrators) with appropriate access permissions.

2. **Bus Information Management:**
    - Maintain a database of available buses, including details such as routes and schedules availability.
    - Support operations for adding, updating, and removing bus information.

3. **Booking Management:**
    - Handle the booking process, including reservation, and ticket generation.
    - Ensure that booking transactions are secure and provide confirmation to users.

4. **Payment Integration:**
    - Integrate with payment gateways to enable secure online transactions.

5. **User Profile and History:**
    - Allow users to create and manage profiles with personal information.
    - Maintain a booking history for users to view their past and upcoming trips.

6. **Search and Filters:**
    - Implement a search functionality for users to find buses based on routes.

7. **Security Measures:**
    - Implement security measures to protect user data, transactions, and the overall integrity of the system.
    - Use encryption for sensitive information, and follow best practices for securing the backend.

8. **API Documentation:**
    - Create comprehensive API documentation to guide developers and third-party integrations.

These functionalities can serve as a foundation for your Spring Boot backend. Feel free to customize and expand based on your specific project requirements and goals. If you have any specific areas you'd like to focus on or if you have additional requirements, please let me know.
